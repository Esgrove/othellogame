# Othello Python

## Dependencies

Install dependencies with pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```console
python3 othello.py
```

In a unix shell (bash etc.), executing directly also works:

```shell
./othello.py
```

**Note:** Windows uses `python` by default for Python 3, 
whereas Mac will only have `python3` in path unless you are using pyenv for example.
