# Othello Kotlin

Requires Gradle.

Build and run:

```shell
./gradlew build

./gradlew run
```

Or with shell script:

```shell
./build.sh
```

Build script will produce a standalone jar using [Shadow](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow)
that can then be run with:

```shell
java -jar othello_kotlin.jar
```
